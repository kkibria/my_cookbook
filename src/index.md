This *Software Development Cookbook* is mostly a collection of notes I took from
my own experience
and many others that I collected over the years and still collecting.

This is mostly disorganized and work in progress. Many things are probably outdated
and need update. Someday I will find time and energy to
clean this up and this may yield into one or more
of finished books, who knows?
