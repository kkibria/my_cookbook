Textual content authoring in html is quite tedious and alternative authoring is 
preferred for web sites.
As such, [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) format has 
gathered popularity and is being used quite widely. This format is really just a simple
text file that can be produced by any text editor.

We will look into Content Management with markdown for web sites. These sites can contain
a collection of markdown files. Content Management allows them to be organized and navigated
in a useful way. They are translated to html before they are rendered in a browser.
