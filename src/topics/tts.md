## Common models

Theses are all based on common models and forked from each other.
* <https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS>  Has low end, Sounds good for theatrical use. Based on following two.
* <https://github.com/mozilla/TTS>    Nice, lacks low end. Sounds natural for musical use. 
* <https://github.com/erogol/WaveRNN> 

I used coqui tts in colab and tried different models and vocoder combinations they have and produced
a zip file consisting of all the audio clips it produced. You can obtain the zip file
[here](../files/tts_gen.zip), if you are interested to take a listen to the audio clips.
