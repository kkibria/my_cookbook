## building a multi-community portal
There are lot of heavy duty social networking sites around us. For a learning exercise,
lets say we are building a social site that hosts multiple commuinities. 
This site will have many registered users. Any of the user can start a community and 
he will be the owner of the community. The community will have a portal and 
owner can configure the look and feel of the portal. Other users can join the
community and some of them will be given the right to author in the portal.
How would we structure our data for such a site?

## NOSQL databse
Lets assume the data will be saved in a NOSQL databse.

The structure will look like,

```
users:
    userid:
```
