Steps:
1. Chop it and adjust position wrt beats.
2. Pitch edit.
3. Adjust clip gain for sibilants.

This goes to 2 parallel channels a and b.

Channel a: 
1. Dynamic control.
3. Add harmonics with saturation (little bit).
3. Dynamic control (which will add more harmonics).
4. Multiband compression.
5. Clean sibilants and breath.

Channel b:
1. Heavily compressed, to blend in. 

Channel a and b merges to:
1. Low shelf 100Hz.
4. Filter for boominess or chest resonance.
5. Low end fix for car speaker (aroud 125Hz).
6. Add saturation to increase dynamics.
7. Clean sibilants again.
8. Some slight eq.
8. Boost high end to add sparkle.
