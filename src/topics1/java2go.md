title: Translating Java to Go language
---

# {{ page.title }}

I have written large Java projects in the past, I have used proprietary
tools to turn them into native executable. The Go language provides a nice 
alternative with several important advantages. Now I am looking into some
automated way to convert may Java codes into Go with minimal manual 
conversions. LLVM, antlr and other tools I am looking at. This will be a 
work in progress for near future.

## Some info on go
* Default go library install path for a user in windows, ``%UserProfile%\go`` directory. Check [Windows special directories/shortcuts](https://superuser.com/questions/217504/is-there-a-list-of-windows-special-directories-shortcuts-like-temp) for similar paths in windows.
* Pigeon is a PEG based parser generator in go. We can use antlr java grammar from and convert in a Pigeon gammer file and use Pigeon to parse.
Check [Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mna/pigeon?tab=doc).

## Use antlr and keep everything in Java world to translate
## Use antlr to generate a java parser in with golang
I prefer this option. This seems to be the path of lease resistance for now.

The author has already created golang parsers for all available grammars in (Github)[https://github.com/bramp/antlr4-grammars.git].
